      <description>It’s a new smart shopping cart that makes a quick grocery trip even quicker by allowing you to skip the checkout line. The cart uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion to identify items you put in the cart. When you exit through the store’s Amazon Dash Cart lane, sensors automatically identify the cart, and your payment is processed using the credit card on your Amazon account.</description>

      <description>LightFinder is a new way to find and buy exactly the light bulb you need and have it delivered to your home. Using computer vision, you can scan your existing product without any prior knowledge and let the app figure out the right shape, base and fit for your needs in a matter of seconds. I worked on this as a member of a small team during my time at Signify (formerly Philips Lighting)</description>
